# Mini-Bio-Weather-Station-v2-Dual-Alarm-System
Low-cost educational biorobot built with Arduino Mini, DHT11 and more. It measures temperature and humidity in real time, plots live curves, changes RGB LED colors by thermal range, and triggers alarms for cold or heat. Developed in adult workshops for the Municipality of San Martín, Argentina.

This project is more than a weather station: it is a low-cost educational biorobot, built from an Arduino Mini starter kit, developed in just three C++ for Arduino classes together with adults with no previous experience in electronics or programming.

⚙️ Technical operation (brief)

Measures temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor.

Displays data on:

Serial Monitor (numeric values)

Serial Plotter (live curves)

Controls an RGB LED by thermal ranges:

Blue → Cold

Green → Mild

Red → Heat

Activates a buzzer alarm under:

❄️ Extreme cold (< 17 °C)

🔥 Extreme heat (≥ 26 °C)

Includes a manual push button to enable/disable the alarm.

Fully based on non-blocking programming using millis() (no delay()).

🤖 Future Data-Driven AI Projection

This biorobot is designed as a foundation for a future data-driven AI system, where climate data may be:

Logged over time.

Analyzed with Python and Data Analytics.

Used for predictive AI models in education, environment and health.

🎓 Educational Context

Developed as an inclusive robotics experience, proving that adults with no prior background can build real functional technology in just a few sessions through hands-on learning.

This project will be showcased at the Technology Fair of the National University of San Martín (UNSAM).
